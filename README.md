<b>Self-Driving Car Simulation Project</b>
This project focuses on simulating a self-driving car system aimed at reducing human errors and making driving safer, more efficient, and enjoyable. The simulation was built using Python, with various modules for visualizing and managing the self-driving experience.

<b>Problem Statement</b>
Human error is the leading cause of road traffic accidents, accounting for around 94% of serious crashes. Factors like misjudgment, speeding, distraction (e.g., phone use), and driving under the influence are significant contributors. This project aims to address these issues by simulating autonomous vehicles that can reduce human error and improve road safety.

<b>Objective</b>
The primary objectives of the self-driving car simulation are:

<b>Minimize Human Errors:</b> Reduce accidents caused by human factors.
<b>Ease Parking Woes:</b> Optimize parking through autonomous driving.
<b>Reduce Traffic Congestion:</b> Facilitate faster, more efficient travel.
<b>Lower Emissions:</b> Enable eco-friendly driving through optimized routes and speed management.
<b>Features</b>
<b>Autonomous Driving Simulation:</b> The car navigates roads automatically, avoiding obstacles and following traffic rules.
<b>Parking Assistance:</b> Simulated parking capabilities for tight spaces, reducing the stress of manual parking.
<b>Traffic Management:</b> Simulation of reduced congestion through better driving habits and route optimization.
<b>Eco-Friendly Routing:</b> Simulates fuel-efficient driving by selecting optimal routes and speeds.
<b>Motivation</b>
The motivation behind this project is to make roads safer by reducing the incidence of human error. Additionally, it aims to make driving less stressful and more enjoyable by introducing self-driving technologies that allow people to socialize, work, or relax during their commute.

<b>Technologies Used</b>
<b>Python 3:</b> Main programming language for building the simulation.
<b>Pygame:</b> Library used to handle graphics and car movements.
<b>Pillow (PIL):</b> For image processing tasks.
<b>NumPy:</b> For numerical operations and matrix handling, which are crucial for decision-making processes in autonomous driving.

Future improvements and features include:

<b>Collaborative Mapping System:</b> Allowing multiple simulated cars to share maps and optimize routes collaboratively.
<b>Real-world Testing:</b> Implementing the simulation with real test runs in controlled environments.
<b>Enhanced Obstacle Detection:</b> Improving object detection capabilities for more complex environments.
